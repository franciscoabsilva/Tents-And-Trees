## Tents-And-Trees
Project for Programming Logic

# Introduction
This project allows users to play the Tents and Trees puzzle game. A game where players navigate a grid filled with trees and tents. The goal is to arrange tents around trees, ensuring that each tree has exactly one tent associated. The grid is a puzzle, with specific rules for the placement of tents and trees, such as no two tents can be placed next to each other, and the number of tents surrounding each tree must match a given number. The challenge lies in logically filling the grid according to these constraints.
